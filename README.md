# Password Generator
This project consists of a simple web app for generating random passwords that the user can easily copy to their clipboard. Users answer a series of prompts which load a validCharacters array with special characters and/or numbers and/or lowercase letters and/or uppercase letters. The password is then randomly generating using this array.
